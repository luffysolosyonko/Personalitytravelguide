    <h2>
        Germany, country of north-central Europe, traversing the continent’s main physical divisions, from the outer ranges of the Alps northward across the varied landscape of the Central German Uplands and then across the North German Plain. One of Europe’s largest countries, Germany encompasses a wide variety of landscapes: the tall, sheer mountains of the south; the sandy, rolling plains of the north; the forested hills of the urbanized west; and the plains of the agricultural east.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Germany is home to over 80 million people – as well as a diverse array of religions, customs, and traditions that make up the rich national psyche. Germany is known for its long and rich history, one that has put it at the forefront of European thought, politics, and art for over 1,000 years. This history has shaped a culture that combines predominantly Christian values with literature, art, philosophy, logic, reason, and, of course, a love of beer and sausages.
        <br/>
        <br>
        Part of a culture that values planning and formalities, Germans are generally reserved. Punctuality is greatly prized. Rules are extremely important to Germans. Do not jaywalk or litter, as you may be subject to a fine. Although many people speak English in large cities like Munich, it is helpful to learn a few German phrases. Remember to say bitte (“please” and “you're welcome”), as well as danke (“thank you”), and you'll make a good impression.

        You should also be mindful of your mannerisms. Whistling at the end of or during a performance is considered a sign of displeasure. When interacting with people one-on-one, remember that touching during conversation or standing less than an arm's length apart on the first meeting is considered an invasion of privacy.
        
        Germany's official currency is the euro. Since the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=EUR&To=USD">exchange rate</a> is before you go. Major credit cards are accepted at some restaurants and shops, but cash is still king in Germany, so be sure to always have some with you. <br/>

<h3>Berlin</h3>
<section id="Berlin">
    <h2>
        Berlin, the capital city of Germany, is renowned for its exceptional range of landmarks, vibrant cultural scene and way of life that's somehow all go yet relaxed. 
        <br/>
        Unquestionably one of the coolest cities in the world, Berlin has a lot more to offer than just beer and bratwurst. The German capital’s famed art scene, coupled with an indefatigable nightlife, gives the city its energetic yet unequivocally gritty character. Described by a former mayor as “poor and sexy”, Berlin attracts people from all over the world with its air of cool mystery, creating a diverse population of over 3.6 million people.

<!-- Berlin - Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor) -->
<section id="Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor)">
    <h2>
        Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor)
        <br/>
        Inspired by the Acropolis entrance in Athens, the Brandenburger Tor (Brandenburg Gate) is one of the most-photographed sites in Berlin. Located in Pariser Platz (Paris Square), one of the city's most famous squares, the Brandenburg Gate was built for King Frederick William II starting in 1788. Designed by royal architect, Carl Gotthard Langhans, the sandstone structure stands 85 feet high.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Since its debut, it's been the backdrop of much of the city's history, including Napoleonic invasions and Nazi parades. During the Cold War, the structure sat in "no man's land" between East and West Berlin, where it was inaccessible to locals and visitors.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Recent visitors said it's a must-see sight that you’ll likely pass by several times during your time in Berlin thanks to its central location. Others recommended admiring it during the day and again at night, when the structure is beautifully illuminated.
        Although it will only take a few moments to snap a picture of the gate, you might want to walk by the tourist information center in the south wing of the Brandenburg Gate and consider the vast history that has taken place here. The gate is accessible 24/7 and is free to visit.

        <br/>
        Museumsinsel (or Museum Island) is the name given to a group of five museums, the Baroque-style Berlin Cathedral and large gardens clustered on a tiny island in the River Spree. Built between 1823 and 1930, some museums present a different aspect of German history and art, while others spotlight global arts and antiques, such as the Egyptian Museum and Pergamon Museum.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Recent travelers said that even if you don't have time to explore all of the museums, the architecture of the buildings and the well-managed gardens are perfect for a stroll or outdoor picnic. If you'd like to visit any of the museums, reviewers suggested purchasing your tickets in advance.
